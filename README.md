## Introduction
ElderCare Hub: Empowering and Enhancing Lives is a special project that uses technology to help older people. It includes things like health monitoring and talking to doctors online. There's also a way for volunteers to help with daily tasks. This project wants to make sure that older people have a good and connected life. Welcome to a place where new ideas are used to celebrate and make life better for our older friends and family.

## Applied Waterfall SDLC Model:
The Waterfall model is a traditional, linear approach where the project progresses through a sequence of phases, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. This model is suitable when the project requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change significantly.

## Waterfall Steps for ElderCare Hub:

## 1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
## Activities:
- Define project objectives and scope.
- Identify stakeholders and gather detailed         requirements for the ElderCare Hub.
